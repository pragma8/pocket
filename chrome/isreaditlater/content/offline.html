    <h1>Using Pocket Offline</h1>

<p>Pocket can download your pages so they are available offline. There are two different views you can choose to download:</p>

<h4>Web View</h4>
<p>The entire page as you would normally see in your web browser.  This includes all images and therefore can take longer to download.</p>

<h4>Text View</h4>
<p>Just the article text, formatted for easy reading.  No images are included which makes downloading faster.</p>


<h3>How to Download Content:</h3>

<p class="padP">
    Open your reading list and click the download button (<img src="../skin/i_down.png" />).  Select the views you wish to download (see
    descriptions above) and click 'Download Reading List'.
</p>
<p>
    Your list will begin downloading in the background so you can do something else while you wait.  When downloading is completed,
    all of your items will be available offline.
</p>


<h3>How to View Offline Content:</h3>

<p class="padP">
    This is all handled for you automatically.  If you have no internet connection and attempt to open a page from your list,
    Pocket will automatically serve you the offline version.
